<p class="txt b">FAQ</p>
<p class="mspaced u">How do I upload a letter?</p>
<p class=spaced>Go to <a href="upload">https://margymail.com/upload</a> or click the <span class=font>Upload a Letter</span> button above. You will be presented with a form asking you to input your name, the applicant&rsquo;s name (whom you wrote the letter for), and the applicant&rsquo;s email address, along with the letter as a PDF.</p>
<p class="mspaced u">How do I deliver my letters?</p>
<p class=spaced>Go to <a href="deliver">https://margymail.com/upload</a> or click the <span class=font>Deliver Letters</span> button above. Enter your mailto codes and the whitelisted email addresses to which you want those letters sent. You can also have MARGY deliver a single letter by sending an email to <span class=i>mailto_code</span><span class=shy>&shy;</span>@margymail.com. In the body of the email, include the whitelisted email addresses to which you want that letter sent.</p>
<p class="mspaced u">How do I add an address to the whitelist?</p>
<p class=spaced>To request that one or more email addresses be added to the whitelist, fill out <a href="addrequest">this form</a> or send a message to <a href="mailto:admin@margymail.com">admin@margymail.com</a>, Subject: Whitelist Addition, with the relevant addresses and links to official job ads <span class=i>that ask that letters be sent to those addresses.</span></p>
<p class="mspaced u">Can applicants read the letters I upload for them?</p>
<p class=spaced>No. Since MARGY only sends letters to email addresses on its whitelist, applicants also cannot break confidentiality by sending the letters to themselves.</p>
<p class="mspaced u">Can MARGY Administrators read my letters?</p>
<p class=spaced>No. MARGY encrypts all letters as they are uploaded. A decryption key is generated and included as part of the mailto code sent to the applicant. <span class=i>That key is not saved anywhere else.</span></p>
<p class="mspaced u">Can MARGY Administrators see where I apply?</p>
<p class=spaced>No, except in rare cases. The only time MARGY logs complete delivery information is when the system receives an error message from an external mail server (this is unavoidable, but extremely rare). MARGY does log how many letters are sent to what addresses (but not which letters are sent) as well as limited information on failed deliveries, including missing files or metadata and non-whitelisted addresses, to aide administrators in addressing user issues. In rare cases, this may allow administrars to <span class=i>infer</span> delivery information from the logs&mdash;e.g., if a user misspells 3 mailto codes, then moments later the system logs 3 deliveries to a whitelisted address.
<p class="mspaced u">What personal information <span class=i>do</span> MARGY Administrators have access to?</p>
<p class=spaced>MARGY Administrators can view the metadata file and letter filenames, so they have access to information about who has written letters for whom. This information is available to the adminstrators because of the costs of hiding it: the system would have to encrypt and decrypt the metadata each time it reads it, which would both slow the system down and make it much harder for administrators to help when problems arise (it would be even harder to avoid their having access to filenames).</p>
<p class="mspaced u">Where can I find out more?</p>
<p class=spaced>You can learn more about MARGY&rsquo;s inner workings by looking at the <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/davidfaraci/margy">source code</a>. There is also a <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/davidfaraci/margy/blob/master/README.md">README</a> with more information about privacy and a detailed explanation of how to read the source code.</p>
<p class="mspaced u">What if I still have questions?</a>
<p class=spaced>MARGY Administrators can always be reached at <a href="mailto:admin@margymail.com">admin@margymail.com</a>!</p>
