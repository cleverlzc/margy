<p style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 1.1em; letter-spacing: .2px; margin: 0 0 1.7em 0;">MARGY received a request from this address for delivery of file {{ file }}. Unfortunately, decryption of {{ file }} failed. Most likely, this is because the decryption key (the last 9 characters of your mailto code) was entered incorrectly. Please check the key and try again. If you are certain that the key was entered correctly, something may be wrong with {{ file }}. In that case, please ask your letter-writer to upload your letter again and use the new mailto code you receive. We apologize for the inconvenience. For questions, or if you believe you received this email in error, please contact <a style="text-decoration: none" href="mailto:admin@margymail.com">admin@margymail.com</a>.</p>
