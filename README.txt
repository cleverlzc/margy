Welcome to MARGY beta testing!

MARGY is a FREE service for managing confidential letters of recommendation on the academic job market. Before we officially launch the system, we want to fix as many bugs as possible, and make MARGY as user-friendly as possible. To that end, please consider participating in the beta test. Explore the website (http://margymail.com), play with the upload system, add your email to the whitelist and use the system to send yourself files. Any feedback on the design or notes on functionality would be greatly appreciated. If you are a coder, you can also check out our source code on GitHub (https://github.com/davidfaraci/margy).

For bugs/specific issues, please create an "Issue" on GitHub. Go to https://github.com/davidfaraci/margy/issues and click "New Issue."

For comments and general suggestions (or if you find a bug but would prefer not to deal with the Issue system), send an email to admin@margymail.com.
